# XML-handler
Read, Write/Append to XML files with PHP
Just a side project of mine  to learn something about XML.

Idea is to play around with XML to see how it works. Prototype projects is a messaging system.
• Main XML file contains all the messages.
• Each user can view only the notes with TO:USER (see show-notes-for-user.php).
• Messages can be added to the XML with append-xml.php
